# Bus-to-Nowhere

A telegram bot to guide the wandering wanderers of Singapore.

## Example

Your location would be sent to the bot, which would automatically find the bus stop nearest to you.

![first command](https://github.com/onefangg/Bus-to-Nowhere/tree/master/examples/first.jpg?raw=true)

You can customise the length of your journey, depending on how far you need to drift away or how close you need to be to reality.

![second command](https://github.com/onefangg/Bus-to-Nowhere/tree/master/examples/jpg.jpg?raw=true)

Next, the bot will find all routes that suit what you need and as well as the nearest bus services that will help you take the first steps towards your journey.

You can also preview the routes that the friendly bot has found for you.

You can then get more details about what bus service to take, and which stops to alight.
